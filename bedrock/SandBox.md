Descartes wanted something he could be certain of. 
Could he even be sure anything about his existence wasn’t an illusion?
Well, the one thing he felt he could be certain of was that he was thinking about / questioning the problem.
You can’t say or conceptualize “I am questioning X” without saying the “I am” part.
At least the fact of his own thinking was something he could have certainty of. And his own thinking entailed that he existed.
