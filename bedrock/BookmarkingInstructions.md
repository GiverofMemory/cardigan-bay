CardiganBay has an easy way to bookmark web-pages into it using [bookmarklets](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/bookmarklets-perform-common-web-page-tasks)

Here's what you do :

Find the link titled "*bookmark to this wiki*" on the bottom of this page (and other pages in the wiki), and drag it into the bookmarks toolbar of your browser. It will become a new bookmark.

Right-click on the bookmarklet and choose *Properties* to rename it.

Now whenever you would like to capture a link to a page you are viewing in the browser, simply click the bookmarklet when you are on the page. (Note, CardiganBay needs to be running for this to work)

It will open a page called [[InQueue]] in your wiki, where the link will have been added as a new card of the :bookmark type.

You can then use the "Send to Another Card" option of the [[CardBar]] to manoeuvre the bookmark card to whichever page you want it on.

You can also edit the page to change the type of the card, or even just remove the link from the card altogether and place it into the text of the page.
