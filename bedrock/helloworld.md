## Welcome to BedRock

This is your default local wiki (affectionately known as BedRock).

And you are on the initial page which is called HelloWorld.

----

As you can see, in [[CardiganBay]] pages are broken into a series of cards. 

Read [[IntroductionToCardiganBay]] for more on the motivations / philosophy and technical decisions of this wiki.

Read [[UserGuide]] for more on the markup and capabilities of this wiki. Including [[GettingStarted]]

----

An important feature of [[CardiganBay]] is that we can manage multiple wikis from a single server.

The special page [[SisterSites]] is where you define both other wikis under control of this engine, and "sister" wikis you want to make links to.
