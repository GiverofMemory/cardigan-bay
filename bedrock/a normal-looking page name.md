It's fine to have page names like this. If you *really* want them.

Note, though, that we use the same name for the file we store the data in as the name of the page. 

That means you really shouldn't have page-names with strange characters in them. Because the computer might not like to have files with those strange characters.

Don't use question-marks (?) Or exclamation points (!) And certainly don't use slashes like / or \ in the page name. Or colons (:) 

Cardigan Bay doesn't mind, but your computer's file system probably **will** mind, and will be confused. It might even stop Cardigan Bay working.

So at this time, we highly recommend that you just don't do it.

Colons particularly suck. Best not to use any punctuation marks, strange accented vowels, commas, brackets, quote marks etc. Just stick to ordinary letters of the alphabet. And ideally, use [[CamelCase]] so you don't even need spaces.

We could try to protect you from this problems. We could, for example, secretly turn all of your weird characters into nice safe underline characters in the file names. But our philosophy is that we aren't here to keep you ignorant of how your computer really works. It's better to *educate* you how your computer works. And it turns out that your computer probably doesn't like odd characters in file names.

And if you learn and respect that, you and your computer will get on much better.
