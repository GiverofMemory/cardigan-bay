### What the hell *is* a wiki, anyway? 

A wiki is like a notebook which is a collection of *named pages* connected by *hyper-links*. That is, it's just like the interwebs ... there are pages, and links in the text on one page that take you directly to another page.

Every page has a name. For example. This page is called "WhatIsAWiki" 

Page names are *unique*. There is only one page called "WhatIsAWiki" etc. Every time you navigate to a page called WhatIsAWiki, you will arrive here. 

Pages can be named anything you like. It's an old tradition in wikis that pages are named as a series of words, whose first letter is capitalized, and which are "smashed together" without spaces between them. For example "WhatIsAWiki" is obviously the phrase "what is a wiki" but put into that format. 

That format is often called "*camel case*". It's not upper-case, it's not lower-case, it's a mixture of the two, which kind of looks like the humps of a camel. Like this : CamelCase.

Like I say, CamelCase is an old wiki-tradition which I kind of like, so I continue to use it. But you aren't obliged to use this for your pages. You can have pages with names that look "normal" eg. [[a normal-looking page name]] if you prefer.
